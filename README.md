# 🐾 Katz 🐾

Welcome to Katz, the ultimate online destination for cat scratchers!

Our mission is to enhance the lives of cats and their owners by providing a diverse range of high-quality cat scratchers. We understand that cats aren't just pets, they're family. That's why we're committed to delivering products that enrich their lives and promote their wellbeing.

Built with Vite and React, our online store offers a user-friendly shopping experience. It's designed with a clean, intuitive interface that makes it easy for customers to find the perfect scratcher for their feline friends.

This project is part of a university course assignment. It represents the application of learned concepts in modern web development. The goal was to create a functional, user-friendly online store specializing in cat scratchers. We appreciate your interest and welcome any feedback or suggestions. 🐈
